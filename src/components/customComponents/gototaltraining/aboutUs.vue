                <p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
                <p>Total Training was founded in 1996 to provide the highest quality instruction to users of creative software. Recognizing that printed instruction was tedious, and classroom training was hard to find and often prohibitively expensive, Brian
                    Maffitt, Total Training CEO and President collaborated to create the first video series, Total AE. The response was overwhelming.

                <p>The Aurora Awards is a international competition designed to recognize excellence in the film and video industries. It specifically targets programs and commercials that would not normally have the opportunity to compete on a national level,
                    by focusing on non-national commercials, regional or special interest entertainment and corporate sponsored film and video. The Aurora Awards recognizes individuals in the film and video industries who have achieved that same ability to
                    captivate their audiences with the displays produced from their own creative forces. Competitors come from private and corporate production groups, advertising agencies and television stations throughout the country.</p>
